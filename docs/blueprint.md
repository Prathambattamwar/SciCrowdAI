# **App Name**: SciCrowdAI Platform

## Core Features:

- Task List UI: Display a list of computational tasks with filtering and sorting options.
- Auth UI: Implement login, registration, and profile management pages with secure authentication.
- Task Submission: Allow users to post computational tasks (e.g., linear regression) with input data.
- Task Details UI: Show task details, including input data, comments, and results.
- Task Processing: Enable users to process tasks and submit results via linear regression.
- AI Result Analysis: Utilize AI to analyze task results, assess accuracy, and provide feedback; make a decision about validity with a tool
- Rewards System: Distribute simulated token-based rewards for task completion.
- Task Filtering and Sorting: Add advanced filtering and sorting options to the task list on the Home page to improve usability for researchers and contributors.
- Enhanced Task Details: Include AI result analysis feedback, a validity decision tool, and token reward display and claiming.
- AI Result Analysis and Validity Decision Tool: Implement an AI-driven module to analyze task results, compute accuracy metrics (e.g., RÂ², residuals for linear regression), and provide a validity decision tool.
- Blockchain-Based Token Rewards: Replace simulated token rewards with a decentralized system using Solidity smart contracts for true DeSci integration.
- Real-Time Task Updates: Add real-time updates for task status and comments using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Advanced Task Filtering and Search: Extend filtering with a search bar and additional criteria (e.g., keywords, reward range).
- Multi-Type Task Support: Support additional task types beyond linear regression (e.g., neural networks, clustering).
- Accessibility Enhancements: Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- User Dashboard: Add a dashboard in Profile to visualize user activity (e.g., tasks posted, completed, tokens earned).
- Notifications System: Implement a notification system for task updates, reward claims, or community events.
- Governance Voting UI: Add a UI for interacting with GovernanceDAO.sol to vote on task validity or platform proposals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF)
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF)
- Accent color: Dodger blue (#1E90FF)
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets and technical information.
- Use modern, geometric icons for tasks, users, and rewards.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout with responsive design for different screen sizes.
